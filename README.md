# Network Monitoring Tool
## This project was developed during my Summer Internship at the Computer Centre of Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (India) in 2024.

➡️ This web-based Network Monitoring Tool was developed using **LAMP** stack, for capturing and displaying network traffic data.  
➡️ Data filtration was implemented using `tcpdump` command & **Bash scripting**, and the presentation of data extracted was executed with **PHP**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.  

### 📔 More information can be found in the [Final Project Report](projectReport_DG.pdf) that I submitted.
